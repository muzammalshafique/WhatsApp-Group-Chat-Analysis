9/4/23, 20:05 - Dr. Azeem Sarwar: We need a bit more granualarity, if that's possible - and also a different color too (what options are available for coloring)
9/4/23, 20:58 - Muzammil Shafique: Sure sir!
9/4/23, 21:19 - Dr. Azeem Sarwar: Also, @923016989458 - can you 1)  filter the records that you couldn't update because of lack of information, 2) copy them in to a separate spreadsheet 3) provide a link here on this group - so we can take on the assignment to update them at our end.

Apologies for not updating here on regular basis but today, I have come up with some of the amazing stats and visuals for NUSTIAN USA. Please have a look üòÉ
9/26/23, 20:36 - Dr. Azeem Sarwar: Thanks @923016989458 - this is great work
9/26/23, 20:37 - Dr. Azeem Sarwar: Can you fill these circles and associate transparency with the fills so overlapping circles can still be pointed out?
9/26/23, 20:38 - Muzammil Shafique: Yes sir. I'll do that IA.
9/26/23, 20:59 - Sir Hammad Kazi: So experience is 0 low rank to 35 high rank?
9/26/23, 21:05 - Dr. Azeem Sarwar: The horizontal axis should say 'Years of Experience' - I believe!
9/26/23, 21:08 - Muzammil Shafique: Yes. I'll correct it too.

9/27/23, 19:30 - Muzammil Shafique: <Media omitted>
9/27/23, 19:33 - Sir Hammad Kazi: Thanks 

Does reflecting relative numbers in each zone add value? Maybe on a second page.
9/27/23, 19:37 - Muzammil Shafique: Actually the color of circle as well as its radius is dependent on number of members residing in that location.
9/27/23, 19:56 - Sir Hammad Kazi: Thanks. Understood. Possible to view those numbers as well.
9/27/23, 20:30 - Dr. Azeem Sarwar: @12177180831 - can you please guide @923016989458 about microsoft 365 access?  He needs access to use MS Office tools

When I started working under sir @12177215752, he gave me 5 tasks:
1. State Visuals of members
2. City visuals of members
3. Experience histogram
4. Histogram for people leader and individual contributor
5. Implementation of charts and graphs of data structures on members so that if somebody wants to contact some member, the chart should recommend him the most relevent person from NUSTIAN USA members.

First 4 tasks were given to me to complete on urgent basis and the last task was to done before this year's November or December.

@12177215752 - As per your instructions, I am going to start the 5th task as soon as possible but if I need to do some other tasks before that, I'll look into that after having discussion with sir Azeem.

Suggestion from all of you will be highly appreciated for my next task or I'll start working on my 5th task described above.

Thank you!

I did some research on WhatsApp group chat analysis and wrote a script. It needs to be refined and more generic to include maximum possibilities. Here is the code:

import csv

# Open the input file with WhatsApp messages
with open('whatsapp_messages.txt', 'r', encoding='utf-8') as input_file:
    # Open the output CSV file for writing
    with open('whatsapp_messages.csv', 'w', newline='', encoding='utf-8') as output_file:
        csv_writer = csv.writer(output_file)
        
        # Write the CSV header
        csv_writer.writerow(['Date', 'Time', 'Sender', 'Message'])
        
        # Initialize a flag to keep track of whether the sender changed the group description
        changing_description = False
        
        # Initialize variables to store multi-line messages
        multi_line_message = ""
        
        # Process each line in the input file
        for line in input_file:
            # Check if the line contains a change in the group description
            if "changed the group description" in line:
                changing_description = True
                continue
            else:
                # Reset the flag if it's a regular chat message
                changing_description = False
            
            # Check if the line starts with a date and time (indicating a new message)
            if line.startswith(('0', '1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9')):  # Check for date and time format
                # If we have a stored multi-line message, write it to the CSV
                if multi_line_message:
                    csv_writer.writerow(['', '', sender.strip(), multi_line_message.strip()])
                    multi_line_message = ""  # Reset the multi-line message
                # Split the line into date, time, sender, and message text
                date, rest = line.split(',', 1)
                time, rest = rest.split(' - ', 1)
                
                if ':' in rest:
                    sender, message = rest.split(': ', 1)
                else:
                    # If there's no ":" in the line, treat the entire line as the message text
                    sender = ""
                    message = rest
            else:
                # If the line doesn't start with a date and time, concatenate it to the multi-line message
                multi_line_message += line.strip()
            
            # Format the fields as desired (date, time, sender, message)
            formatted_message = [date.strip(), time.strip(), sender.strip(), message.strip()]
            
            # Write the formatted message to the CSV file
            csv_writer.writerow(formatted_message)
        
        # Check if there's any remaining multi-line message to write to the CSV
        if multi_line_message:
            csv_writer.writerow(['', '', sender.strip(), multi_line_message.strip()]) <This message was edited>
10/3/23, 08:44 - Muzammil Shafique: I'll work on it further and share the final code here, very soon, IA.
10/3/23, 08:52 - Muzammil Shafique: @12177180831 - I sent a message to this email requesting for Microsoft 365 access to my account 6 days ago but haven't received any response. I have no access to Microsoft Office currently.
10/3/23, 08:55 - Mam Nayab Shiraz: Thanks for letting me know. Let me ask :)
10/4/23, 16:44 - You changed the group name from "NUSTIAN USA: Engagement, Analytics, and Insights" to "NUSTIAN USA Engagement, Analytics, and Insights Group"
10/4/23, 16:46 - Muzammil Shafique: Sir @12177215752 - I needed a bit change in name of group to run analytics on chats. Semicolon in the group's name was causing error.
10/4/23, 17:05 - You changed the group name from "NUSTIAN USA Engagement, Analytics, and Insights Group" to "NUSTIAN USA: Engagement, Analytics, and Insights"
