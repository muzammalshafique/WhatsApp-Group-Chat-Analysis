10/23/21, 16:49 - Rida SNS: Thankyou!!
10/23/21, 17:00 - Rida SNS: @923016989458 can you please confirm the syllabus for ohts for the remaining subjects
10/23/21, 17:04 - Fatima Kiyani SNS: Yes please
10/23/21, 17:25 - Mahnoor SNS: Yes, please
10/23/21, 19:39 - Muzammil Shafique: Ok. Let me ask.
10/23/21, 19:43 - Muzammil Shafique: Real Analysis, chap. # 18 & 19
10/23/21, 20:18 - Muzammil Shafique: Chapter 1 to 3.only.
10/23/21, 20:18 - Muzammil Shafique: And a simple case study will be included.
10/23/21, 20:18 - Muzammil Shafique: 30marks total.
10/23/21, 20:18 - Muzammil Shafique: Mam Shaherbano ^
10/23/21, 20:19 - Muzammil Shafique: Everything is included in Topology's OHT except last lecture.
10/23/21, 20:40 - Fatima Kiyani SNS: Complex?
10/23/21, 21:08 - Muzammil Shafique: I confirmed from him again but he is saying k everything is included.
10/23/21, 21:18 - Rida SNS: Even the last lecture?
10/23/21, 21:33 - Muzammil Shafique: Yes..
10/23/21, 21:58 - Fatima Kiyani SNS: He said it wouldnt be tho‚Ä¶
10/23/21, 21:58 - Yusra SNS: <Media omitted>
10/23/21, 22:02 - Mariam SNS: Yeah wtf
10/24/21, 00:34 - Muzammil Shafique: Everything else bubble sort
10/24/21, 00:34 - Muzammil Shafique: Mam waaarda^
10/24/21, 13:46 - Durr e Najaf SNS: <Media omitted>
10/24/21, 13:46 - Sahiqa SNS: <Media omitted>
10/24/21, 13:46 - Sahiqa SNS: In question 4 here
10/24/21, 13:46 - Sahiqa SNS: And this question we solved
10/24/21, 13:47 - Sahiqa SNS: Why is it that f(x) in question 4 is integrable
10/24/21, 13:47 - Sahiqa SNS: When the conditions are so similar to this
10/24/21, 13:52 - Mahnoor SNS: What are the page numbers
10/24/21, 13:56 - Sahiqa SNS: 244 and 248 I think
10/24/21, 15:20 - Hamza SNS: not every positive integer includes both the values, hence only finite intervals will have U(P) - L(P) = 1 . in which case we can reduce |P|->0 and it'll be integrable.
10/24/21, 15:20 - Hamza SNS: as much as I understood.
10/24/21, 17:10 - Sahiqa SNS: If you were to mention that would you write it as a statement or would try to prove it
10/24/21, 17:14 - Hamza SNS: I think a statement would suffice
10/24/21, 17:51 - Lari SNS: Use subinterval (1,1/2), (1/2,1/3), (1/3,1/4) so on.  U will see that Upper sum -Lower sum=0 always so by Riemann integrability criterion this is indeed integrable.
10/24/21, 17:51 - Lari SNS: Upper and lower sum on each individual subinterval is the same.
10/24/21, 17:53 - Hamza SNS: apparently we should be able to prove without this technique as its mentioned much later in the book and we haven't been taught .
10/24/21, 17:54 - Hamza SNS: this is correct ofcourse
10/24/21, 17:54 - Hamza SNS: but if there is a simpler , more basic explanation I would like to know
10/24/21, 17:56 - Lari SNS: Use Riemann integrability def directly I guess.
10/24/21, 18:16 - Hamza SNS: don't waste our time.
10/24/21, 18:16 - Faisal SNS: Don't waste our time!
10/24/21, 18:16 - Hasnain SNS: Don‚Äôt waste our time

With teams sponsorships, marketing and external relations as its embellishing assets, GS wing is the representative face of NLC's covenants and memoranda. They are the handshakers - the social crew of NLC.
This wing calls out to all the passionates who possess the intrinsic urge of selling ideas, glorifying the efforts and attracting some patrons to nurture a cause.

You have to write it's code and know what each line means
Also finding the time and space complexity of said algorithm

She may also include any data structure

She said she'll assign it before the OHTs

Proof can be provided.

12/14/21, 16:29 - Muzammil Shafique: Dark Matter outweighs visible matter roughly six to one making up about 27% of the Universe and yet we've never been able to directly detect dark matter in any form. Fascinating, right? 

If you have any idea about where it might be or want to discuss about dark matter and its theories, then GEAR UP! 

NUST Physics and Astronomy Society (NPAS) is offering an interactive and open discussion thread about dark matter, its possible whereabouts, and much more. 

You can use the link below for some light pre-discussion reading about the existing theories on Dark Matter.

We are one step away to adopt an excellent habit of cleanliness and for that, NCBS is aiming to achieve a healthy, sterile, and beautiful life by contributing to a cleanliness movement.
"The only way forward, if we are going to improve the quality of the environment, is to get everybody involved." ‚Äì Richard Rogers
In spite of the increase of environmental hazards, litter and debris, creating a clean and safe environment is a must and a responsibility for all. This could be done through small efforts of awareness, showing by example, and making it a priority for everyone. Admittedly, at the end of the day, the place we are keeping clean and safe is for no one else but ourselves.

To volunteer for the cleanliness drive, apply here:
https://forms.gle/xhBZ1dW4bkhDEDM9A

Grab this opportunity and chip in to play your part in this great endeavor brought to you exclusively by NCBS especially for the freshman! Volunteer for our cleanliness drive and kill two birds with one stone by not only contributing to a better environment but also exploring the majestic wonders of NUST.
So, what are you waiting for? Apply now!

We also want to know why your parents send you to NUST. As we know everyone is not available for survey, we would like to call some of your parents. Therefore we request you to send your parents number in  reply to this email or you could add the number in the comment section of the surveys along with your comments.

This is very important to us. So please give us five minutes. And we thank you in anticipation.

Hope you have good grades.

‚ÄúDo Good As Allah Has Done Good to You.‚Äù
(Al-Quran, 28:77)

Catastrophic floods in Pakistan caused by monsoon rains have killed over 1000 people in the last few weeks, affecting millions of people. The country has suffered extensive damage to homes, roads, bridges, and power plants, with Sindh and Punjab provinces getting hit the hardest. The situation has massively deteriorated as one-third of Pakistan has now become uninhabitable due to flooding and landslides. The magnitude of the disaster has prompted Pakistan's government to declare a national emergency.

 Therefore, *SNS* is also organizing a flood relief campaign tomorrow to help those in need. We hope you will continue to play your part in this noble cause with open and kind hearts.
